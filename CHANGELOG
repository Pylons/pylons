Pylons Changelog
================

1.0 (May 27, 2010)
* Minor tweak to allow proper importing of pylons.

1.0RC1 (March 1, 2010)
* Switched to using Routes 1.12 with support for no longer using the odd
  routes singleton.
* Removed pylons.middleware.StaticJavascripts, this is not used anymore.
* Added more unit tests.

1.0b1 (February 5, 2010)
* Removed CacheMiddleware. cache object is now setup as an attribute on the
  app_globals object for use where needed.
* WARNING: config only supports dict access
* WARNING: Method arguments no longer assigned to 'tmpl_context' by default.
* WARNING: Changed default to strict_tmpl_context.
* WARNING: Removed legacy pylons.c and pylons.g globals.
* WARNING: Removed legacy pylons.database module.
* WARNING: Removed legacy pylons.config module.
* WARNING: Removed Buffet options, setup, and legacy render/render_response
  function from pylons.templating. This also means config no longer accepts
  the add_template_engine option.
* WARNING: Removed legacy redirect_to function.
* WARNING: @https decorator no longer accepts url_for-like arguments.
* Add a "paster routes" command.  This prints the mapper, which from Routes
  1.12 onwards gives sensibly formatted output.
* Fix unit tests on Windows
* Prepare for Routes 1.12, ensure tests don't assume implicit routing

0.10 (May 27, 2010)
* Fix legacy warning replacement.

0.10RC1 (March 1, 2010)
* No changes to Pylons core since b1.

0.10b1 (February 5, 2010)
* redirect_to is now deprecated, use redirect(url(*args, **kwargs)) instead.
* url_for like args to the https decorator are now deprecated, pass it a url
  or a callable returning a url instead.
* Changed 1.0 deprecated pylons.c, pylons.g, pylons.buffet instances to
  throw deprecation warnings.
* Fixed etag_cache matching when the If-None-Match header contains a comma
  separated list of etags. Fixes #557. Thanks magicbronson.
* Added tests for restcontroller with sub-directory, and fixed generated unit
  tests. Patches supplied by Michael van Tellingen, fixes #571.
* Retain the original controller exception when thrown under
  environ['pylons.controller.exception'] for use in the error controller.
* Fixed bug with unit tests running the app load twice during testing.
  Fixes #620.
* Updated project templates to use actual config instance, rather than the
  StackedObjectProxy classes.
* Changed PylonsConfig to be dict subclass, rather than DispatchingConfig
  subclass.


0.9.7 (February 23, 2009)
* WARNING: A new option is available to determine whether or not an actions
  arguments should be automatically attached to 'c'. To turn off this implicit
  behavior in environment.py:
    config['pylons.c_attach_args'] = False
  This is set to True by default.
* WARNING: Fixed a minor security hole in the default Pylons error page that
  could result in an XSS security hole.
* WARNING: Fixed a security hole in the default project template to use the
  StaticURLParser to ensure arbitrary files can't be sent.
* WARNING: Refactored PylonsApp to remove legacy PylonsApp, moved
  session/cache and routes middleware into the project template. This will
  require projects to be updated to include those 3 middleware in the projects
  middleware.py.
* Added redirect, preferred over redirect_to. Takes an explicit url instead of
  url_for like arguments
* Changed to using WebTest instead of paste.fixture for app testing.
* Added render_mako_def to render def blocks within a mako template.
* Changes to cache_decorator and cached_template to support Beaker API
  changes in version 1.1.  1.0.3 is still supported.
* Fix HEAD requests causing an Exception as if no content was returned
  by the controller. Fixes #507. Thanks mvtellingen, Petr Kobalicek.
* Fix a crash when returning the result of ``etag_cache`` in a controller.
  Fixes #508.
* "response" flag has been removed from pylons.decorators.cache.beaker_cache, 
  as it sends all headers along unconditionally including cookies; 
  additionally, the flag was taking effect in all cases previously 
  so prior versions of beaker_cache are not secure.
  
  In its place, a new option "cache_headers" is provided, which is a
  tuple of specific header names to be cached.  It defaults 
  to ('content-type','content-length').
* "invalidate_on_startup" flag added to beaker_cache, which provides a 
  "starttime" to the cache such that when the application is started
  or restarted, the cache entry is invalidated.
* Updating host to use 127.0.0.1 for development binding.
* Added option to specify the controller name with a __controller__ variable
  in the controller's module. This name will be used for the controller class
  rather than the default naming scheme.
* setup.py egg_info now restores projects' paster_plugins.txt,
  allowing paster shell to work again after the egg-info directory was
  lost. fixes #282. Thanks sevkin.
* The paste_deploy_config.ini_tmpl template is now located at
  package/config/deployment.ini_tmpl for new projects.
* Project's default test fixtures no longer hardcode test.ini; the ini
  file used can now be specified via the nosetests --with-pylons
  argument (defaults to test.ini in setup.cfg). fixes #400.
* @validate now defaults to translating FormEncode error messages via
  Pylons' gettext catalog, then falls back to FormEncode's. fixes #296.
  Thanks Max Ischenko.
* Fixed SQLAlchemy logging not working in paster shell. Fixes #363. Thanks
  Christoph Haas.
* Added optionally engine initialization, to prevent Buffet from loading
  if there's no 'buffet.template_engines' in the config.
* Updated minimal template to work with Tempita and other new templating
  changes.
* Fixed websetup to parse location config file properly when the section
  isn't 'main'. Fixes #399.
* Added default Mako filter of escape for all template rendering.
* Fixed template for Session.remove inclusion when using SA. Fixed 
  render_genshi to properly use fragment/format options. Thanks Antonin 
  Enfrun.
* Remove template engine from load_environment call.
* Removing template controller from projects. Fixes #383.
* Added signed_cookie method to WebOb Request/Response sub-classes.
* Updated project template to setup appropriate template loader and controller
  template to doc how to import render.
* Added documentation for render functions in pylons.templating.
* Adding specific render functions that don't require Buffet.
* Added forward controller.util function for forwarding the request to WSGI
  apps. Fixes #355.
* Added default input encoding for Mako to utf-8. Suggested in #348.
* Fixed paster controller to raise an error if the controller for it already
  exists. Fixes #279.
* Added __init__.py to template dir in project template if the template engine
  is genshi or kid. Fixes #353.
* Fixed jsonify to use application/json as its the proper mime-type and now
  used all over the net.
* Fixed minimal template not replacing variables properly. Fixes #377.
* Fixed @validate decorator to no longer catch exceptions should they be
  raised in the action that is supposed to display a form. Fixes #374.
* Fixed paster shell command to no longer search for egg_info dir. Allows
  usage of paster shell with installed packages. Suggested by Gavin Carothers.
* Added mimetype function and MIMETypes class for registering mimetypes.
* WARNING: Usage of pylons.Response is now deprecated. Please use
  pylons.response instead.
* Removed use of WSGIRequest/WSGIResponse and replaced with WebOb subclasses
  that implement methods to make it backwards compatible with the Paste
  wsgiwrappers.
* Fixed missing import in template controller.
* Deprecated function uses string substitution to avoid Nonetype error when
  Python optimization is on. Fixes #334.
* E-tag cache no longer returns Content-Type in the headers. Fixes #323.
* XMLRPCController now properly includes the Content-Length of the response.
  Fixes #310, thanks Nicholas.
* Added SQLAlchemy option to template, which adds SQLAlchemy setup to the 
  project template.
* Switched project templating to use Tempita.
* Updated abort/redirect_to to use appropriate Response object when WebOb is
  used.
* Updated so that 404's properly return as Response objects when WebOb is in
  use instead of WSGIResponse.
* Added beaker_cache option to avoid caching/restoring global Response values
  that were present during the first cache operation.
* Adding StatusCodeRedirect to handle internal redirects based on the status
  code returned by the app. This replaces the use of ErrorDocuments in
  projects.
* Refactored error exceptions to use WebError.
* WSGIController now uses the environ references to response, request, and
  the c object for higher performance.
* Added optional use of WebOb instead of paste.wsgiwrapper objects.
* Fixed bug with beaker_cache defaulting to dbm rather than the beaker
  cache app-wide default.
* The --with-pylons nose plugin no longer requires a project to have been
  registered with setuptools to work.
* The config object is now included in the template namespace.
* StaticJavascripts now accepts keyword arguments for StaticURLParser.
  Suggested by Marcin Kasperski.
* Fix pylons.database.AutoConnectHub's doInTransaction not automatically
  connecting when necessary. Fixes #327.

0.9.6.1 (September 27th, 2007)
* Fixed validate decorator to resume pre-0.9.6 behavior of only validating
  POST requests by default. Added option to validate during GET as well and
  a recursion avoidance check to prevent validate from running more than once.
* WARNING: Fixed a security hole allowing private controller methods (those
  beginning with an underscore) to be accessed from the outside. Found by
  Tomasz Nazar.
* Added nose plugin '--with-pylons=test.ini' option to load the Pylons app 
  before scanning for unit tests. This enables Pylons apps to be unit tested
  with doc tests.
* PylonsBaseWSGIApp now caches controller lookup and the effective logging
  level for a little better performance.

0.9.6 (September 8th, 2007)
* Updated requirements for newer WebHelpers for SQLAlchemy 0.4 compatibility.
  Fixes #300.
* Fixed pylons.templating to not pull session objects if there are none in use
  for the request. Thanks Bob Ippolito.
* Catch UnicodeEncodeErrors when finding the Controller action method and fail
  gracefully. Thanks max. Fixes #298.
* Allow passing of a state keyword to the validate decorator for the
  to_python methods. Fixes #297.
* paster shell now configures logging from the config file, like paster serve
  and setup-app. This can be disabled via the -q option. Thanks Yannick
  Gingras.

0.9.6rc3 (August 18, 2007)
* Fixed controllers.core to allow responses of None (empty bodies). Logs a
  message indicating the response was empty.
* pylons.helpers has been moved to pylons.controllers.util, to differentiate
  between controller utility functions and projects' helpers modules.
* Fixed non-basestring/generator/WSGIResponse objects returned from
  Controllers not being set as the response content. Thanks Alex Conrad.
* development.ini now configures the app's Logger level to DEBUG by default.
  Thanks Christoph Haas

0.9.6rc2 (August 2, 2007)
* Projects now include a MANIFEST.in file: it directs distutils to recursively
  include all files in the project's public/ and templates/ dir. This fixes
  these dirs not being included in dists unless they were checked into an RCS
  recognized by setuptools. This is at the expense of dists now globbing all
  files in those dirs (even those not checked into your RCS). Thanks Christoph
  Haas.
* Fixed the validate decorator not setting c.form_errors in certain
  circumstances. Thanks max. Fixes #286.
* email_to lines commented out in development.ini and test.ini files to avoid
  emails being sent to a non-existent address by mistake. If an error occurs 
  it is logged but no email is sent unless email_to is specified.
* [paste.app_factory] entry points changed to point to the actual make_app() 
  function to make it simpler for someone to work out how Pylons works (tests 
  updated accordingly too).
* All use of the ez_setup module is now tested by an ImportError to make 
  Pylons compatible with Buildout. Note: Tags and releases should be made
  using an svn export and an svn add to ensure a real copy of the ez_setup
  module is included and not just an svn:external so that the module is tied
  to time of the release.
* More full-featured README.txt included.
* Updated beaker_cache to cache global response cookies/status/headers. 
  Fixes #280.
* Fixed missing abort name import in restrict rest decorator. Fixes #281.
* Added cheetah as a supported template language for template_engine option.
* Fixed public/ and templates/ directories not being created with paster
  create.

0.9.6rc1 (July 15, 2007)
* Fixed cookie header addition to use add instead of append. Thanks to 
  anonymous patcher. Fixes #268, again.
* Added ability to pass _code option to specify the status code type for
  redirect_to.
* Fixed redirect_to to not copy all headers into redirect for old _response
  usage. Fixes #268.
* WARNING: By default, the Pylons request object now returns unicode
  parameter (pylons.GET/POST/params) values (and assumes those parameters
  were sent to Pylons as utf-8). Unicode parameters can cause major
  problems if your application is not setup to handle unicode. To disable
  unicode parameters (0.9.5 default behavior), add the following to your
  load_environment function (0.9.6 syntax):

  config['request_options']['charset'] = None

  or, if still using the deprecated pre-0.9.6 pylons.config syntax, add:

  request_settings = pylons.config.request_defaults.copy()
  request_settings['charset'] = None
  return pylons.config.Config(tmpl_options, map, paths,
                              request_settings=request_settings)

* WARNING: Template names beginning with a / (or the OS's path separator)
  will now result in the name not having the separator's replaced with '.'s
  for the template engine. This shouldn't affect most projects as they usually
  assume a dot notation will be used with dot notation template engines (Kid, 
  Genshi, etc.). This change allows template engines that can take filename
  paths to function properly. Fixes #233.
* WARNING: The pylons.util.get_prefix(environ) function is deprecated. Please
  use:
      environ.get('SCRIPT_NAME', '')
  instead (the get_prefix function is used in the default ErrorController).
  Fixes #243.
* WARNING: The paths dictionary's 'root_path' has moved to the less
  redundant 'root'.
* Fixed the Error Documents/EvalException css referencing non-existent images.
  Thanks Shannon -jj Behrens. Fixes #238.
* Added ability to pass _code option to specify the status code type for
  redirect_to.
* Fixed redirect_to to not copy all headers into redirect for old _response
  usage. Fixes #268.
* Added logging statements throughout Pylons code, added logging setup to
  default template. Fixes #98.
* Refactored global response to be setup in wsgiapp along with the other 
  globals. Updated WSGIController to copy in global response headers and
  cookies into a WSGI app's output.
* Added global pylons.response object. Thanks Shannon -jj Behrens and Damjan
  Georgievski. Fixes #268 and #201.
* Updated default project template files for new configuration layout. Options
  to handle config now just in environment.py, and middleware.py handling just
  middleware. Fixes #203.
* Removing mako tests, as its now the default. Default test changed from 
  Myghty to Mako.
* Changing default templating to mako.
* Added the https decorator. It requires an action to be loaded via
  https. Patch by ido. Fixes #241.
* Added upgrade instructions, and posted a copy on the wiki. Fixes #230.
* Added deprecation warnings for usage of the Pylons Controller class, all
  controllers should inherit from WSGIController instead. Fixes #239.
* Removed deprecated attach_locals function from Controller class.
* Added an authenticate_form decorator for use with WebHelpers'
  secure_form_tag functions for preventing CSRF attacks. Original patch
  by David Turner. Fixes #157.
* Fix Buffet's include_pylons_variables not being upheld. Thanks Jonathan
  LaCour.
* The validate decorator now accepts extra keyword arguments (**htmlfill_kwargs)
  to pass along to formencode's htmlfill.render function.
* Removed POST-only restriction on validate decorator, now handles GET 
  requests. No form arg required during a GET request, which will run the
  current action with c.form_errors set to the errors. Fixes #246.
* Added PylonsConfig, which gets accessed as pylons.config dict. Contains
  all the merged ini options, in addition to the Config options such as
  'routes.map', 'pylons.paths', 'buffet.template_options', etc. Check the
  pylons.config docs on PylonsConfig for dict keys populated by it.
* Split up resolution stages in wsgiapp, so that controller lookup is a
  separate function making it easier to subclass. PylonsApp now takes a 
  base_wsgi_app argument which is then used for the BaseWSGIApp instead of the
  one from wsgiapp.py.
* Added mako template render tests.
* Added storage of the action func used to handle a call, for later code that
  might need a reference to the action that originally handled the request.
  Fixes #253.
* Updated config object to optionally take a single merged conf dict, updated
  project templates to pass around the single merged conf dict.
* Changed project template to use new Beaker session keys.
* Changed default routing for raw template matching to not unicode decode the
  route argument. Fixes #242.
* Catch any exceptions raised by template engine entry points and emit a
  warning instead of crashing. Thanks markbradley. Fixes #249
* Fixed the validate decorator not working with formencode's
  CompoundValidators when variable_decode=False. Fixes #209.
* Fixed the validate decorator failing with a KeyError when no value is
  specified to validate against for separate validators (as opposed to a
  schema). Reported by Graham Stratton.
* Fixed paster shell not merging app_conf and global_conf into the main CONFIG
  dict namespace. Original patch by David Smith. Fixes #244.
* Added logging to decorators. Refs #98.
* Fixed paster restcontroller to test for lib.base and only add that import 
  statement when its present. This fixes the restcontroller template when used
  with minimal Pylons project templates. Fixes #237.
* Fixed the EvalException debugger showing broken links and buttons when the
  app's ErrorController was broken (such as when BaseController's __before__
  raises an exception). Suggested by Ian Bicking. Fixes #228.
* paster create now accepts a 'template_engine' option to setup the new
  project's default template engine. E.g. to create a new project that
  uses Genshi by default, use:
  paster create --template=pylons mygenshiproj template_engine=genshi
  Suggested by Ian Bicking. Fixes #141.
* Fixed the validate decorator triggering the following error with
  FormEncode>=0.7 and non-ascii rendered form content:
  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 10:
  ordinal not in range(128) the form was passed in as an encoded string, but
  some data or error messages were unicode strings; the form should be passed
  in as a unicode string
  Reported by Christoph Haas.
* HTTPExceptions are now converted to Response objects (for __after__),
  making the httpexceptions middleware no longer required.
* Added Warning to jsonify to warn about cross-site attacks when returning
  a list as the outer-most element to jsonify. Fixes #232.
* Fixed beaker_cache decorator to take optional keyword arguments intended
  for the backend cache container (such as url for memcached).
* Fixed paster controller assuming the minimal template was in use when
  the lib.base module existed but raised an exception.
* Fixed bug in XMLRPC Controller not setting proper Content-Type. Fixes #236.
* Added the '-d' ('--disable-ipython') option to paster shell for
  disabling IPython.
* Allow creation of controllers named 'setup' via paster controller.
  Reported by Matt Good.
* Added support for generic arguments to SQLAlchemy's create_engine of
  the form sqlalchemy.* from the PasteDeploy config file.

0.9.5 (Apr 11th, 2007)
* Fixed a Python 2.3 incompatibility with paster shell, causing the
  Exception:
  File "Pylons-0.9.5-py2.3.egg/pylons/commands.py", line 357, in command
    locs.update([(name, getattr(base, name)) for name in base_public])
  AttributeError: keys
* Fixed paster shell breaking for projects where the base package was not
  the first package listed in top_level.txt. Patch from Alberto Valverde.
  Fixes #229.
* Fixed doc references to config['app_conf']. Fixes #116.
* Changed `get_engine_conf` to properly evaluate sqlalchemy echo statement
  when its 'debug'. Fixes #226.
* make_session and create_engine now accept keyword arguments to pass to
  SQLAlchemy's create_engine.
* make_session now accepts the keyword argument 'session_kwargs' to pass
  to SQLAlchemy's create_session.
* Fixed _inspect_call to call function with keyword arguments instead of list
  args. Corrects issue with action defaults that caused the value for the 
  latter args to be in the wrong spots. Spotted by Topher. Fixes #223.
* Added the allow_none option (passed to xmlrpc.dumps) to XMLRPCController.
  Suggested by Jaroslaw Zabiello.
* Updated XMLRPC Controller with patch for name lookup and additional unit
  tests for the patch. Fixes #216.
* Updated docs for validate decorator to more clearly illustrate what the
  post_only args apply to. Fixes #221.
* Added ability to return strings in the WSGIController. Fixes #218.
* Added lazy i18n translation functions. Patch from David Smith. Fixes #181.
* Added fix for XMLRPCController system.methodHelp function and unit test.
  Patch and unit test submitted by Graham Higgins.
* Fixed bug in validate decorator with new UnicodeMultiDict response content
  not properly retaining form content as unicode for formencode's htmlfill.
* Fixed bug in XMLRPC Controller with xmlrpclib Faults not being properly
  transformed into a WSGI response within the controller.
* WARNING: Pylons now requires the decorator module: it no longer packages
  it as pylons.decorator. Code relying on the pylons.decorator.decorator
  function will trigger a deprecation warning and should be changed to use
  decorator.decorator.
* WARNING: pylons.h was deprecated for using projects' lib.helpers module
  directly in 0.9.3. pylons.h is now formally deprecated (emits
  DeprecationWarnings). Projects still accessing pylons.h must change the
  following import:
      from pylons import h
  to:
      import MYPROJ.lib.helpers as h
* pylons.jsonify and pylons.Controller references have been deprecated
  (they are misplaced references). They continue to be available at
  pylons.decorators.jsonify and pylons.controllers.Controller, as they always
  have been.
* Updated templating Buffet to recognize format parameter and properly pass it
  to the template engine.
* Updated LICENSE for new year and to indicate license covering templates
  generated. Fixes #188.
* Interactive debugger now supports Mako. After r1780 if you are using a 
  custom theme you will need to change '%(myghty_data)s' to 
  '%(template_data)s' in your template. If you are using JavaScript the tab 
  id is now "template_data".
* Fixed bug in WSGIController with private function attempts not returning a
  valid WSGI response.
* Added full unit test coverage of cache decorator.
* Adding messages binary file, enabling i18n unit tests. Updating pylons.i18n
  to import LanguageError. Fixes #193.
* Adding i18n tests, not active yet as they're waiting on a binary file from a
  patch. Refs #193.
* Updated tests so that they now work with nose, removing py.test requirement.
* Switching config setup to load keys into main config dict with app_conf and
  global_conf keys set for any code looking for those keys. Fixes #116.
* PylonsInstaller is now the default paste.app_install entry point for new
  projects: this makes Cheetah no longer required for the paster make-config
  command. (Thanks Alexander Schremmer, Ian Bicking)
* Added custom redirect_to function in pylons.helpers that will take an
  optional _response arg to pull headers and cookies out for preservation
  during a redirect. Fixes #136.
* Changed config.Config.__init__ to take all options as keyword args so
  unused args can be skipped. Fixes #162.
* The request object can now automatically decode GET/POST/params vars to
  unicode, when its charset attribute is set.
* Added a new request_settings keyword arg to Config's constructor. Allows
  setting the default charset and errors values of of the request object.
* Deprecated Config constructor's default_charset keyword arg. Use Config's
  response_settings keyword arg instead.
* Fixed paster controller to test for lib.base and only add that import 
  statement when its present. This fixes the controller template when used with
  minimal Pylons project templates. Fixes #140 and fixes #139.
* Fixed the paster shell error: KeyError: 'pylons.routes_dict' when calling
  app.get and app.post.
* Fixed paster shell not working on projects with names containing hyphens.
* Fixed the config directive 'sqlalchemy.echo' set to False being interpreted
  as True. Patch by Alex Conrad.
* Fixed paster shell not restoring CONFIG['global_conf'].

0.9.4.1 (Jan. 5th, 2007)
* Added restcontroller command that generates a RESTful controller template
  and provides the appropriate map.resource command to add. Suggested by 
  Matthew Scott.
* Fixed SQLObject pylons.database.PackageHub error:
  exceptions.NameError: global name 'CONFIG' is not defined
* Fixed pylons.database.session_context not working outside of requests
  (such as in websetup.py).
* Updated template options config to take template options for multiple 
  engines for less binding to Myghty.
* Fixed paster shell incorrectly importing the the tuple (model,) as the
  model object.

0.9.4 (Dec. 29th, 2006)
* WARNING: Removed the lang_extract and lang_compile commands. They used
  pygettext.py and its associated msgfmt.py, which lacked the ability to
  extract ngettext style function calls and had issues with unicode strings.
  The new I18NToolBox project aims to provide this functionality (and more)
  via the gettext command line utilities. http://i18ntoolbox.ufsoft.org
* All Pylons special objects are now available within paster shell (not just
  h and g).
* WARNING: Myghty's allow_globals config var has changed, causing the
  following when running pre-compiled templates:
      Error(TypeError): do_run_component() takes exactly 13 non-keyword
      arguments (5 given)
  Delete the compiled Myghty templates directory (specified by cache_dir or
  myghty_data_dir in the config file) to resolve the error.
* Changed i18n functions in templates to use proxy objects so that using
  set_lang in a template works right. Fixes #153.
* Now allowing any template plugin to overwrite global PYLONS_VARS (such as c,
  g), not just pylonsmyghty.
* Adding SQLAlchemy support to the database.py file. Saves the session engine
  to g to maintain it during the apps lifetime. Uses SessionContext plugin for
  management of the current session.
* Updated config object so that init_app can take an optional template engine
  argument to declare the default template engine.
* Updated Myghty plugin to use extra_vars_func when passed in.
* Fixed Buffet to use extra_vars_func properly.
* Fixed the validate decorator when there are validation errors and
  variable_decode=True: now passing the original params to htmlfill.render
  instead of the varable_decode'd version. Patch by FlimFlamMan.
* Added ungettext function for use with pluralized i18n, and the N_ function
  (gettext_noop) to mark global strings for translation. Added ungettext, N_
  and translator objects to be globals for templates. Refs #126.
* WARNING: The localization function '_' now uses ugettext (returns unicode
  strings) instead of gettext. To preserve the old behavior, append the
  following line to your project's lib.base and lib.helpers imports:
  from pylons.helpers import gettext as _
* Pylons special objects are now available within the interactive debugger
  (deprecating _attach_locals).
* Added setup-app run before unit tests run so that webapp has proper setup
  tasks handled. Fixes #113.
* Added paste.deploy.CONFIG setup to middleware.py, websetup.py and testing
  files in the Pylons project templates. Closes #112.
* Added security policy doc to index for use as Pylons security policy.
  Closes #91.
* Improved the repr() of the c context object to show attributes.
* Set environ['paste.testing_variables'] whenever that key is available, not
  just in testing mode.
* Added capability to have an action be a generator function.
* Added introspection capability to XMLRPCController and signature checking.
* Updated Controller to use additional arg lookup scheme so that the source of
  the function args for _inspect_call can be easily overridden.
* Updated RPCController, renamed to XMLRPCController. XMLRPCController now
  functions properly and will automatically return proper xmlrpc responses.
* Added test configuration ini file to default template. Closes #114.
* Fixed problem with pylons.database.PackageHub.__get__ raising errors
  other than AttributeError when the database isn't configured.  Added
  new UnconfiguredConnectionError exception, instead of just KeyError
  or TypeError (depending on what part of the configuration failed).
* Fixed default g init, since bare object has no init method. Reported by Ian 
  Bicking.
* Fixed issue with SQLObject method override having wrong name. Reported by
  climbus with patch. Fixes #133.
* Moved log function to pylons.helpers and translation functions to
  pylons.i18n. using pylons.util purely for Pylons internal util functions.
* WARNING: Removed 0.8.x legacy code and backwards compatibility functions.
* PylonsApp now has option to not use Routes middleware, default resolving 
  uses new wsgi.org routing_args spec.
* Refactored routes dispatching to use new Routes middleware.
* Fixed paster shell command to properly acquire mapper object without
  relying on the template being configured in a specific manner.
* Added keyword argument pool_connection to
  pylons.database.PackageHub; if set to false then SQLObject connections
  won't use pooled database connections (a new connection will be
  opened for each request).

0.9.3 (Nov 1st, 2006)
* Updated project template to support full_stack option to make it easier to
  use Pylons apps within larger WSGI stacks.
* Added deprecation warnings to legacy objects and for 1.0 functionality that
  will change.
* Added cache decorator and Cheetah template functional tests. Patch and unit
  tests provided by Climbus.
* Fixed readline support in the stock interactive console paster shell.
  Reported by Alex Conrad.
* A controller's __after__ method will now be called after actions invoke
  redirect_to (or raise any HTTPException). Reported by David Turner.
* Fixed config to use myghty_data_dir instead of cache_dir setting if its 
  set as well. Reported by Shannon -jj Behrens.
* Added traceback hiding so that more of the traceback relating to Pylons code
  is removed from the default traceback making it easier to focus on the code
  in an app that actually caused the problem. Closes #119.
* Added ability to use '_' translation method directly from templates and in
  the controller without having to use it under h._.
* Added 's' and 'l' Myghty escaping flags to default project templates. 
  Suggested by Jamie Wilkinson. Closes #110.
* Fixed SCGI bug with QUERY_STRING test when WSGI states it doesn't have to
  exist. Reported by Riklaunim.
* Added pylons_minimal template, prone to fine-tuning.
* Added option for PylonsApp to take a globals object to avoid checking a
  hardcoded path for a Globals object.
* Removed old Helpers legacy object entirely, replaced pylons.h with proper
  StackedObjectProxy. Cleaned up PylonsApp and PylonsBaseApp to accept a
  helpers reference so that Pylons can be ignorant of where the helpers came
  from.
* Fixed bug with lang app_conf option being set improperly. Reported
  by Laurent.
* Fixed pylons.h to work proper with new and old-style helper imports.
* Fixed render functions always passing disable_unicode=False to Myghty.

0.9.2 (Sept. 7th, 2006)
* Fixed problem with dashes in controller names, resolves #107.
* Updated default ini file to use localhost from address. Refs #104.
* Updated default development.ini to use a single cache_dir setting which
  is the base dir that cache files, session files, and template caching will
  be saved in. Config object now looks to cache_dir setting properly for
  Myghty templates. Fixes #104.
* Updated default template controller to provide better example of directly
  serving Myghty templates.
* Fixed legacy (0.8) controller methods' **ARGS (also m.request_args and
  pylons.params) to be of the expected mixed dictionary instead of MultiDict.
* Fixed _attach_locals not attaching g and cache objects.
* Added g object to the shell. Works as long as the Pylons app can respond
  to a path of '/'. The pylons.g variable will also be setup properly for
  use in the shell.
* Myghty template options are now passed properly to the template creation, and
  allow_globals now works to add Myghty template globals.
* Re-organized helpers, switched Helpers class to use static methods to reduce
  code duplication.
* Helpers cleanup:
    - Old-style Helper object uses StackedObjectProxy just like the new
      scheme, thus avoiding possible WSGI stack issues.
    - New project templates use new-style Helpers scheme.
    - Updated wsgiapp to utilize new Helpers cleanup style. The 'h' object
      is now friendlier to use, and maps directly to a projects lib.helpers 
      file. No more wacky Helpers object proxying to it.
    - Added translator global to __init__.py for use with new Helpers cleanup.
    - Copied Helpers function methods directly into util so they can be used
      stand-alone.
    - Deprecated h.lang (for h.set_lang/h.get_lang)
* Moved the 'default_charset' option from PylonsApp's constructor to
  Config's.
* Added 'error' controller route to the top of the Pylons template to avoid
  the common issue people discover when removing the generic default route.
* Changing validate decorator to have variable_decode option, which will
  also run formencode's variable_decode function over the form input.
* Switched to using Context obj classes instead of RequestLocal which is
  being phased out.
* Added an 'encode_variables' option to the validate decorator.
* Switched all current_obj calls to _current_obj to avoid triggering
  deprecation warnings.
* Added is_xhr to Request object in Paste.
* Bumping up dependency to latest Paste.
* Switching back to prior controller import check, throwing a more detailed
  error with a suggest fix should the user really want a URL with that name
  in it. (refs #67)
* Fixes bug with prior fix for #67. Wasn't properly testing the full package
  name to include the current project which would incorrectly restrict
  valid controller names (refs #67).
* Fixed '_method_' checking to test in a more efficient manner.
* Added deprecation warning for legacy mode activation. Not necessary to
  update multiple files, as all of legacy mode is enabled via the Legacy
  WSGI app. Fixes #89.
* Fixed controller command to check controller name and refuse to create
  controllers that have name clashes with existing modules that could be
  imported. Reported (with patch) by Chuck Adams. Fixes #67.
* Added capability for 'c' object to throw an exception when an attribute
  is used that doesn't exist. Closes #84.
* Fix for endless error document call when an error document controller
  wants to throw a error that the error_mapper catches.

0.9.1 (August 11th, 2006)
* Fixed __all__ export typo in templating.py. Added example of render
  with a template.
* Fixed issue with set_lang not using proper CONFIG var.
* Minor tweaks to update docs in pylons.helpers and move remaining legacy
  code into legacy module. Updated wsgiapp to refer to new locations of
  legacy compatibility objects.
* The interactive debugger's 'full traceback' link is now only displayed
  when the full traceback differs from the regular (includes hidden
  frames).
* Providing an optional text version of exception tracebacks and the
  associated extra data within the interactive debugger.
* The 'Debug at: http://hostname/_debug/view/XXXXX' URLs now display the
  interactive debugger properly skinned.
* Fixed issue in PasteScript with new controller sub-directories lacking a
  __init__.py file. This fixes an import error when using the controller.
  PasteScript dependency updated to fixed version. Reported by Artur Lew.
* Removed lowercasing of the module name during resolver import.
* Removed [full] recommendation from docs.

0.9 (July 28th, 2006)
* config file option 'debug' now defaults to false when undefined
* Removed the components directory from the template
* Updated paste.errordocuments support
* Fix for multi-word controller names such that front_page / 
  FrontPageController can be used as a controller name. Patch contributed
  by Timo Mihaljov.
* Cleaned up imports in wsgiapp and new project to better reflect where
  things really come from.
* Removed unnecessary myghty usage from wsgiapp for url unescaping, now
  uses urllib as the myghty function did.
* Removing 'response' to import, sticking with Response as its more
  consistent with the fact that Response is a class/factory and not an
  instance like request, and the other lower-case objects.
* Added redirect_to under pylons.helpers, and added import from helpers
  directly into lib/base.py for use in controllers.
* Consolidated legacy objects into legacy module.
* Adding abort method that raises the appropriate exception for the status
  code.
* Removing form_fill, obsolete by the validate decorator.
* Relocated 'params' object to only take effect in legacy mode.
* Updated Pylons template to use WSGIController as the new default Controller.
* Altered the wsgi dispatch to examine the controller, and instantiate it if
  it's just a class. Otherwise, if the controller is a subclass of Controller
  but not of WSGIController, it assumes its an older Controller class that
  may return a WSGIResponse, and calls it appropriately.
* Dispatch now fixes up environ to move 'path_info' Route var into the WSGI
  PATH_INFO, and the rest is pushed into SCRIPT_NAME. This is for use with
  other WSGI apps under controller mount points.
* Added WSGIController which takes a normal WSGI interface call and returns
  the appropriate WSGI response.
* Added automatic copying of Route variables declared in an action's
  function definition to the 'c' object.
* WebHelpers' .js files are now automatically published under the 
  '/javascripts/' URL path. Individual WebHelpers' .js files can be
  overridden by other .js files inside the project's 'public/javascripts'
  directory
* Added exception toss when a template engine doesn't exist.
* Added alias option to Buffet to support aliasing more template engines
  to other engine names
* Buffet enhancements to support caching of any template with any template
  engine
* All render commands processed through Buffet
* Backwards compatibility 'm' object for use with legacy projects
* Added use of Beaker middleware for session and caching functionality
* Fixed error traceback and updated template to use proper error images and
  stylesheets.

0.8.2 (**dev**)
* Fixed default controller to allow for actions with - in them. The - will be
  replaced with an underscore, while the original action name in the mapper
  dict is unchanged. Patch by Thomas Sidwick.

0.8.1 (May 10th, 2006)
* Added REST decorators and re-arranged decorator layout to support more styles
  of decorators for future expansion.
* Fixed dependency requirement bug that had Pylons locked to simplejson 1.1
  even though a newer version was out.
